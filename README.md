This is a stock market chart written with Full-Stack JavaScript. Users can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock and add/remove stocks. Using websockets, a user can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock.

This project was made with Node.js and Express on the back end. The front end is written in React with Redux and is based off of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The app can be found on Heroku [here](https://thawing-atoll-75323.herokuapp.com/).
